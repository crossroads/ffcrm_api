# FfcrmApi

This is a plugin for Fat Free CRM that provides an API to access data using REST principles and serialized as json.

The use case currently driving development of the API is to connect with Ember.js applications.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:* Whilst we are developing this plugin, this will be unstable code.

When the API reaches a stable version 1.0 we will mostly likely incorporate it into the Fat Free CRM and release it.

## Features

* None yet. This is a stub.

## TODO

Everything!

Some specifics:

* Deal with authentication
* Integrate active_model_serializers
* Develop EntityAPI controller to serialize and return the API as json

## Tests

* Inside the ffcrm_api folder, run ```rspec```

## Contributions

Fat Free CRM developers who have an interest in pushing towards a stable API are welcome to submit pull-requests, but I'd rather just add you as a collaborator to the github project.
